# Vizly

**Vizly** is a collection of animated guides to system design, security, and complex engineering concepts. 

Vizly is a collective "interactive notebook" designed to capture core engineering concepts. The goal is to make complex topics intuitive through visual, animated explanations rather than just reading boring documentation.

If you find this useful, or see something that could be better, you are more than welcome to contribute!
